## Introduction

The catalog website is a user friendly store for anyone to use. The website controls all of
the buying and selling so there is no user interaction. The user will need a username and
password to make any actions on the website. With the connection to the database, the
users information will be able to be saved and checked when buying or selling.


## Detailed Functionality & Requirements

The website will record the limited items posting date and time to record when the item
will be deleted 24 hours later.
The website allows any item to be bought or sold for any price, there is no checks on the
items or prices. The users are in charge.
The website purchases the items and then sells it to the users so there buyers and sellers
won't need to communicate.
There will be 3 lists that the user can look through to purchase an item, the list will either
be regular, limited, or special.
